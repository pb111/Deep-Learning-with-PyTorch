# **PyTorch**

PyTorch is an open source machine learning library based on the Torch library. It is used for applications such as computer vision and natural language processing. It is primarily developed by Facebook's AI Research lab. It is free and open-source software released under the Modified BSD license. PyTorch also has a C++ interface.

PyTorch provides two high-level features:[13]

  - Tensor computing (like [NumPy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NumPy) with strong acceleration via [graphics processing units](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphics_processing_unit) (GPU)
  - [Deep neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning#Deep_neural_networks) built on a tape-based [autodiff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Automatic_differentiation) system
  
 
## **Dependencies**

- Python 2.7 or 3.5+

- PyTorch 0.4.0+
